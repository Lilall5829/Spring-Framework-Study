            GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) provides principles for assigning
            responsibilities to
            classes and objects in object-oriented design. It aims to promote a clear and modular design, fostering
            maintainability and adaptability as the system evolves.

        <ul>
            <li>
                a. Information Expert: The Student class holds information about individual students, including their
                ID,
                name,
                and age. This class was chosen as the Information Expert because it naturally encapsulates the essential
                attributes of a student.
            </li>
            <li>
                b. Creator: The StudentController creates a new Student object and adds it to the StudentService. This
                approach
                is better than using the main method directly because it encapsulates the creation logic within the
                controller,
                promoting better separation of concerns and maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
                c. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is introduced into the application by creating multiple subclasses of the
                Student
                class. And created two types of students: regular students and honor students. Honor students have an
                additional
                attribute to represent their GPA. I introduced a HonorStudent subclass of Student that includes the GPA
                attribute. The StudentService and StudentController handle both regular and honor students. In the
                Thymeleaf
                template, I used polymorphism to check the type of each student and display the GPA only for honor
                students.

                <br>Polymorphism allows us to treat objects of different types (regular students and honor students)
                uniformly,
                making the code more flexible and extensible.
            </li>
            <li>
                d. Indirection: The StudentController acts as an intermediary between the user's request and the
                StudentService.
                It benefits by promoting loose coupling between the controller and the service, allowing for easier unit
                testing
                and potential future changes in the service layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                e. Pure Fabrication: I introduced a "Course" class as an example of a pure fabrication. The "Course"
                class
                does not
                directly represent a concept in the problem domain but is created to illustrate the concept of a pure
                fabrication. Each student can be associated with one or more courses. The "Student" class now includes a
                list of
                courses, and students can be associated with courses. The "StudentController" creates instances of
                students
                and
                courses and associates students with courses. This demonstrates the use of a pure fabrication to model
                an
                additional concept within the application that doesn't directly correspond to the problem domain.
